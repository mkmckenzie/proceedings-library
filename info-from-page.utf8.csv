Production capability was not fully used, and additional LFG was flared. The district negotiated a contract with its waste collection contractor to purchase BioCNG fuel. The agreement allowed the contractor to purchase a new CNG fleet and the district to develop the first satellite CNG fueling outpost supplied by a transport trailer filled at its primary (landfill) location.<br>            <br>            Description<br>            St. Landry Parish Solid Waste District installed a BioCNG biogas processing system in 2012 to make compressed natural gas (CNG) vehicle fuel for municipal vehicles, including Sheriff's Department cars, light duty trucks and a light duty van, and the solid waste district's utility trucks. The award winning project came about due to the district's 2008 decision to invest in a landfill gas (LFG) collection and flaring system to market greenhouse gas (GHG) offsets. That successful voluntary project provided an opportunity to find a beneficial use for the gas. After evaluating the potential beneficial uses for the collected LFG, the dDistrict deemed the biogas-to-vehicle fuel project to be the most economical choice. The SW District continued to expand its CNG vehicle fleet. As a result of the growing fleet, coupled with their history of fueling, the district worked on plans to expand its fueling capacity contemplating further growth in the use of biogas as a vehicle fuel. The best way to economically grow the BioCNG program was to increase CNG fuel demand. Parish residents embraced the original fueling concept, and some of the local communities have expressed a desire to have the BioCNG vehicle fuel available at a convenient off site location. However, this fuel demand alone would not allow the district to expand the system.  The district did recognize Progressive Waste Solutions, the Parish's solid waste hauler, as a potential CNG user, but all of the existing vehicles were diesel powered. Due to hard work and diligence by the district, a mutually beneficial agreement was reached with Progressive for that company to convert its waste hauling fleet to CNG and commit to purchase a satisfactory volume of landfill derived CNG. One requirement of the CNG purchase agreement was for the district to have an un-interruptible CNG supply for the trucks. Adding backup natural gas to the landfill's BioCNG fueling station was not an option due to the distance to the nearest pipeline. The district decided to install an off-site CNG fueling station (satellite site) that would be supplied by the use of a CNG tube trailer filled at the landfill fueling station (primary site). The satellite site would have backup natural gas in the event that BioCNG was not available. This primary/satellite system also provides an off-site BioCNG source in the most populated Parish community and will be made available to the general public. This is the first development of a primary/satellite mobile fueling station that utilizes biogas derived CNG as the primary fuel source.<br>            <br>            Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br>            1)  understand economic and physical considerations for expansion of the BioCNG processing facility<br>            2)   create a win __ win solution in developing a CNG vehicle fuel demand<br>            3)   understand logistics of providing BioCNG fuel to a remote location            <br>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: top;"">            <p style=""text-align: left;""><img style=""width: 200px; height: auto;"" alt=""Steven Wittmann"" src=""http://www.swana.org/Portals/0/events/speakers/SteveWittman.png"">            </p>            </td>            <td style=""text-align: left; vertical-align: top;""><strong>BIO:            </strong>            Steven Wittmann has more than 40 years of experience in the environmental investigation, engineering and construction field.

Many landfills are running out of options of what to do with this ongoing issue and are turning to leachate evaporation that utilized landfill gas as a fuel source to evaporate the volumes that once were having to be hauled to local treatment facilities.<br>            <br>            Description<br>            The development and implementation of the Subtitle D rules in the mid-1990s have dramatically improved waste handling and disposal practices in the United States. These regulations have improved human health and the environment where waste management intersects with our lives. Significant reductions in contamination of ground water and air quality, as well as disease carrying vectors and nuisance odors are attributable to improved design, construction, and operation of landfills under Subtitle D. These regulations also have presented challenges related to the costs of these operations.  Not the least of these is related to leachate management.  Collecting, storing and disposing of leachate in an environmentally responsible manner can be very burdensome and costly to the operation of a Subtitle D landfill. This presentation discusses problems encountered by one Subtitle D facility in South Carolina, one in Alabama and how they are reviewing the technology that was utilized on a Subtitle D facility in North Carolina that had similar problems. We will discuss the process of evaluating the various solutions that these sites investigated, judging both economic and technical feasibility criteria. Attempts to partner with local municipalities to extend service to the landfill were made, and programs including recirculation and pump/haul disposal were implemented at various times or not allowed.  While each of these approaches showed promise at times, economic and other issues also presented new problems to be dealt with. This led the facility in North Carolina to explore a program it had evaluated previously; leachate evaporation. The landfill engaged in conversations with a third-party developer/operator of leachate evaporators. These conversations quickly turned into negotiations for turn-key management of a leachate evaporator with a capacity of 34,000 gallons per day using landfill gas as its sole source of fuel.  Several steps went into the project, from both solid waste and air permitting modifications, agreement negotiation, to evaluation of existing leachate quality, design of the evaporation facility, management of residual material, operator selection and training, and startup. This project has been running continuously and steadily for more than three years now.  Future plans are for possible expansion of the project using techniques currently under development to capture waste heat from landfill gas to power generators currently installed and operating.   Just recently, the site in North Carolina has conducted additional testing on the particular matter that is generated in the evaporation process which is then discharged to the atmosphere and the findings also are discussed in the presentation.<br>            <br>            Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br>            1)  see how at one time the problem with disposal of leachate on their landfills can now be destroyed safely and cost efffectively by utilizing a resource that they are producing already on the landfill.            <br>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: top;"">            <p style=""text-align: left;""><img style=""width: 200px; height: auto;"" alt=""Daniel DeArment"" src=""http://www.swana.org/Portals/0/events/speakers/DanielDeArment.png"">            </p>            </td>            <td style=""text-align: left; vertical-align: top;""><strong>BIO:            </strong>            Daniel is a graduate of Penn State with a Bachelor's degree in civil engineering.

State legislation and regulatory agencies made clear a statewide 75% recycling goal. In 2014, the District's debt from its 1996 MRF would be paid off and the MRF would require upgrades. In 2015, the franchise agreements in seven of its member communities would expire.  The key to success was to work regionally to develop a unified vision while respecting the unique character and needs of each community. The District engaged HF&amp;H Consultants to work with the District and member communities to define the goals and the methods for achieving them, including: 1) new infrastructure to support processing of all waste, recycling, organics, and C&amp;D in the region; 2) recovery of energy and fuel products; 3) competitive procurement for franchise collection services; and, 4) a business model that aligns with a future with less waste.

He recently completed design of an interception barrier to allow continued operation of a landfill that has elevated temperatures from exothermic reactions. In addition to heat transport, he has evaluated groundwater transport of contaminants and migration of landfill gas. He was the originator of the concept of landfill gas rather than leachate as the source of volatile organic compounds in groundwater and has obtained regulatory approval for natural attenuation of landfill gas impacts on groundwater in California and for groundwater contaminants ranging from coal ash constituents to uranium in various other states.  He has worked on landfills in Australia and has obtained regulatory approval of natural attenuation of landfill gas migration in both the U.S. and Australia.            </p>            </td>        </tr>    </tbody></table>",LFLMOP Workshop<br />Trends in Beneficial Use of Landfill Gas and Potential Impacts of Organics Diversion,"<table>    <tbody>        <tr>            <td style=""text-align: left; vertical-align: top;"" colspan=""2"">            <br>            <strong> ABSTRACT:</strong><br>            EREF estimates 382.5 million tons of MSW was generated in 2013 with 66% of this waste being landfilled.  It is the biodegradable organics in this waste mass that are broken down anaerobically to create biogas consisting of methane and carbon dioxide.  Of the 251.3 million tons of MSW placed in landfills, roughly 43% is biodegradable.  The majority of the biodegradable waste material placed in a landfill consists of food waste, yard waste and wood or woody materials.<br>             <br>            While the biogas generated in a landfill can contribute to global warming, methane also has the potential to be beneficially used for heat, fuel or electricity.  In a landfill, the extent to which biogas can beneficially utilized is based on factors such as the waste composition going to the landfill, volume of biogas generated, the existence of a gas collection system, and other factors such as market demand for certain types of biogas products (i.e. electricity, compressed natural gas, heat).  While estimates have been made to assess the extent to which landfill gas is being collected and utilized (e.g. LMOP, GHG reporting tool), more detailed assessments to understand metrics, such as the fraction of placed MSW tonnage that go to landfills with beneficial gas use, have been more fragmented.<br>             <br>            EREF has conducted a study that evaluated landfill gas utilization practices of roughly 1,500 active landfills.  The primary objective of this work was to understand to what extent landfill gas is being beneficially used, what primary end uses are being employed, and the extent of differences in private versus publicly owned operations.   Results suggest that approximately 85% of tonnage going to landfills in the U.S. is being placed in landfills that have gas collection systems and that, of this, roughly 75% of the landfill gas is being beneficially used.  Significant policy changes are occurring in various states that have the potential to drastically change the landscape of landfill gas to energy.  These recent trends in organics diversion policy include restrictions and bans on organics going to landfills.  Part of the analysis performed evaluates the impact on landfill gas generation and utilization if increasing diversion occurs over time.  Additionally, results from life cycle analyses will be compared in this presentation as well that look at relative impacts in using landfill gas to energy systems versus other options such as anaerobic digestion, composting.            <br>            <br>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: top;"">            <p style=""text-align: left;""><img style=""width: 200px; height: auto;"" alt=""Bryan Staley"" src=""http://www.swana.org/Portals/0/events/speakers/BryanStaley.png"">            </p>            </td>            <td style=""text-align: left; vertical-align: top;""><strong>BIO:            </strong>            <p style=""text-align: left;"">            Dr. Bryan Staley currently serves as president and CEO of the Environmental Research and Education Foundation (EREF), one of the largest sources of research and scholarships related to solid waste management.

Difficulties with the Ontario approvals process will be discussed, as well as broader difficulties, including the sensitivity of energy prices and utility incentive programs on the economic viability of such projects. The importance of non-economic drivers will be reinforced.<br>            <br>            Description:<br>            The City of Kawartha Lakes (CKL) is a municipality located in Central Ontario, Canada, with a population of 75,000. The City owns and operates five landfills, the largest of which is the Lindsay/Ops Landfill located north of the Town of Lindsay. There are currently 900,000 tonnes of waste in place, with a total capacity of 1,500,000 tonnes. In June 2008, modifications were made to Ontario waste management regulations to address greenhouse gas emissions from landfill gas As a result, it became a requirement for any operating landfill site with a total waste capacity greater than 1.5 million cubic metres to implement landfill gas control. The Lindsay/Ops Landfill fell into this category, and in 2008, CKL applied for funding through the Ontario Ministry of the Environment and Climate Change (MOECC). CKL was successful in obtaining two-thirds funding for a landfill gas collection, flaring and utilization project. A detailed design was completed, and the flaring and collection system were tendered in advance of the landfill gas utilization component. The landfill gas flare and collection system was constructed during 2011 and has been operational since March 2012, flaring on the order of 115 cfm of landfill gas at 42 percent by volume methane. The landfill gas utilization component of the project was anticipated to involve a landfill gas fuelled engine that would provide electricity for both the landfill and the adjacent Water Pollution Control Plant (WPCP).  Based on the amount of landfill gas available, a 335-kilowatt engine was specified, which closely matches the load at both facilities. This project was tendered in September 2011. When pricing was received, it was higher than anticipated and the economics of the project were re-evaluated. Recommendations were made to City Council not to proceed with the landfill gas utilization component of this project; however, City Council overturned this and called for further measures to be taken to reduce cost and move this green energy project forward. In 2012, (as a cost-saving measure) CKL purchased a 335-kilowatt engine directly that would be supplied to a successful contractor to install. The project was re-tendered in this format, and construction began in October 2014. Construction was completed during July 2015, and connection to the electricity grid was scheduled for August 26th, 2015. The project has been plagued by challenges including the following:<br>            - 	timing constraints due to funding deadlines imposed by the MOECC  <br>            - 	approval processes that have significantly changed since the beginning of the project (i.e. the Ontario Renewable Energy Approval process).  <br>            - 	the sensitivity of the project's rate of return given current energy prices and available incentive programs.  <br>            - 	lack of submitted tenders and tender prices in excess of expectations.  <br>            - 	limited economy of scale with respect to landfill gas pre-treatment for small electricity generation projects.     <br>            The challenges listed are interconnected and affect either the timing of the project and/or the overall economic viability. Despite these very significant challenges, CKL continued to push this project forward and now looks forward to producing enough green power to operate their facilities.<br>            <br>            Following this presentation, participants will be able to...<br>            1)  understand the difficulties of implementing a small landfill gas to energy project.<br>            2)   understand the sensitivity of energy prices and utility incentive programs on the bottom line.<br>            3)   understand the importance of non-economic drivers for these types of projects.<br>            </td>        </tr>        <tr>            <td style=""text-align: center; vertical-align: top;"">            <p style=""text-align: left;""><img style=""width: 200px; height: auto;"" alt=""Denise Burgess"" src=""http://www.swana.org/Portals/0/events/speakers/DeniseBurgess.png"">            </p>            </td>            <td style=""text-align: left; vertical-align: top;""><strong>BIO:            </strong>            Denise Burgess is an Ontario Professional Engineer and received her Bachelor's degree in cvil engineering from the University of Waterloo She has been practising in the environmental field for more than 17 years and been involved in more than 30 landfill gas related projects in Canada.
